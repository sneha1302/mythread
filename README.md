Homework 1
==========
A non pre-emptive user-level threads static library `mythread.a`

Compilation
-----------
From the terminal:
```
# make
```
or
```
# make all
```
These two commands will have literally the same effect. 

For verbose compilation:
```
# make debug
```
This bakes in debugging symbols for use with gdb with the `-ggdb` option and prints all warnings 
with the `-Wall` option. This will also verbosely print archiving messages from `ar`.
